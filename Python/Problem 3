-----## This is extremely slow for large numbers such as n = 600851475143 (the number in question). I'll find a more efficient way later.

n = int(input())
num = []

for i in range(2, n+1):
    if n % i == 0:
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                break
        else:
            num.append(i)
print(max(num))
